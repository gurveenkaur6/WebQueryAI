# WebQueryAI üï∏Ô∏èüìë

WebQueryAI is an application that leverages LangChain framework and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to provide insightful answers to user queries based on the content of any loaded website. By integrating advanced text processing, vector embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, WebQueryAI offers an intelligent and efficient way to interact with web content.

## Features

- **Load Web Content**: Easily load and parse content from any URL.
- **Advanced Text Splitting**: Break down content into manageable chunks for better processing.
- **Vector Embedding and Retrieval**: Utilize sophisticated vector embedding techniques for accurate content retrieval.
- **Intelligent Question Answering**: Generate precise answers to questions using a powerful combination of prompt templates and the GPT-3.5-turbo language model through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **LangChain**: Provides the framework for creating and managing the various components used in the application, such as document loaders, text splitters, vector stores, and RAG chains.
- **OpenAI**: Utilizes the GPT-3.5-turbo model for generating high-quality responses.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Parses HTML content from web pages, focusing on specific elements like post content, titles, and headers.

### Frontend

- **Streamlit**: Offers a user-friendly interface for loading web content and interacting with the application. Streamlit handles user inputs, displays messages, and manages session states.
